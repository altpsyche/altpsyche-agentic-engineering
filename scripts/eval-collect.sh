# <case> is resolved as eval-sandbox.sh resolves it; the sandbox is ../eval-<token> beside this
# checkout, as eval-sandbox.sh built it. Under a `## Collect, run <token>` heading, each command
# gets its own fenced block: `$ ` and the command as the case writes it, then its output, stdout and
# stderr together, then `(exit <n>)` when it did not exit 0. A failing command is recorded, not
# fatal: its output is evidence too. A case it cannot parse, a malformed token or a missing sandbox
# appends nothing and exits 1.
