# Builds the sandbox for one eval case, exactly as evals/README.md § Sandbox defines it: a private
# GitHub repo whose main is one commit holding this checkout's tree without the case folders, with
# the case's Starting state blocks run as written at their steps. evals/README.md stays the
# definition; this script types it for the runner.
#
#   <checkout>/scripts/eval-sandbox.sh <case>
#
# <case> is a path relative to this checkout's root, such as evals/work/red-baseline.md, or an
# absolute one. The checkout is the branch under test, everything committed. The sandbox is
# ../eval-<token> beside it, and the repo's description marks it as a sandbox, naming the run token
# and the source commit, so the cleanup at merge can prove it is one:
#
#   eval-sandbox run <token> from <40-hex source commit>
#
# Its last lines are `token: <token>`, `path: <sandbox>` and `prompt:` followed by the prompt. Any
# failure stops it: the run has no sandbox to reach, so it is void, not graded (evals/README.md
# § Running a case). Needs gh, authenticated, git, node and openssl.
