# Saves your TypeSafe key where every Jev tool finds it (ADR-0002): TYPESAFE_API_KEY in the file
# `node scripts/jev/env-file.mjs path` names, by default the gitignored .env at the root of the
# main clone, which serves the clone and every sibling worktree. Reads the key without echoing it,
# writes it single-quoted so a `#` or a space in it survives, replaces any earlier
# TYPESAFE_API_KEY line, keeps every other line, and leaves the file readable by you only. It
# refuses a file inside a repo that does not ignore it. Rerun it to change the key; an empty answer
# changes nothing.
#
# With --offer, as scripts/bootstrap.sh calls it, it first asks whether to add a key at all, and
# only when neither the shell nor the file has one. It always exits 0 then, since the key is
# optional and setup goes on without it.
